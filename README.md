# syringe

**syringe** is a Python-based tool designed for automated security testing. It facilitates the execution of payloads against specified targets, streamlining the process of identifying potential vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Organize and manage various payloads efficiently.
- **Target Management**: Easily specify and handle multiple targets for testing.
- **Result Logging**: Store and review the outcomes of executed payloads.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stuxve/syringe.git
   cd syringe
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure Targets**:
   - Edit the `targets.txt` file to list the targets you wish to test, one per line.

2. **Set Up Configuration**:
   - Modify `syringe.conf` to adjust settings as needed for your testing environment.

3. **Execute the Tool**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The tool will read the targets and payloads, execute the tests, and log the results accordingly.
